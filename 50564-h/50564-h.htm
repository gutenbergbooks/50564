Ink <span class='fss'>IS</span> history, in the common
acceptation of the word; for,
what is generally denominated
history—is ink diffused on
paper in certain definite lines. Yet
ink has no history written or composed
hitherto. In view of this
deficiency—which betrays a singular
negligence (on the part of historians and
all literary men) and a thoughtless ingratitude
to this indispensable means of accomplishing
and preserving their work—we
propose to supply the desideratum, by
furnishing, on these little pages, what is
indicated by the above title, in the fullest
sense and widest scope of the term, including
its etymology, its chemistry, and all
that can be suggested and justified by
the title, or fairly demanded under it, or
claimed from it.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>The great common error of general historians,
ancient and modern, (with a very
few exceptions among the moderns,) has
been, that they have given to the world
little else than narrations and descriptions
of wars and treaties, of governmental
changes and political events, omitting to
record the often far more important facts
in the history of literature, science, and the
arts of utility, by which the progress of
civilization and the development of the
human race in its higher capacities have
been effected or aided. The great “Instaurator
of the Sciences” was the first
to call attention to these omissions and
deficiencies in all previous histories, and to
indicate the duty of historians to avoid
these errors,—setting a good example in
that respect, in the specimen, or model
work, which he produced as a pattern,—his
history of the reign of Henry the
Seventh. Since his time, many special
histories of inventions and of the arts of
utility have been written; and the numerous
cyclopaedists have largely contributed
to this object; still, however, leaving many
vacancies to be filled in this department of
human knowledge, of which the one before
us can not be considered the least worthy
of the labor needful for its investigation.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>
  <h2 class='c006'>DEFINITION.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>The word <span class='fss'>INK</span> has been variously defined
by lexicographers, cyclopaedists and chemists;
but the following terms may be taken
as fully expressing the common qualities
and essential specific characteristics of all
substances included under the name.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Ink</span> is a colored liquid employed in
making lines, characters or figures on surfaces
capable of retaining the marks so
made. The Encyclopaedia Britannica,
(vol. xii. p. 382, 1856,) gives the following
definition: “<span class='fss'>INK.</span>—The term ink is
usually restricted to the fluid employed in
writing with a pen. Other kinds of ink
are indicated by a second word, such as
red ink, Indian ink, marking ink, sympathetic
ink, printers’ ink, etc. Common
ink is, however, sometimes distinguished
as writing ink.”</p>

<p class='c000'>As to <span class='fss'>COLOR</span>,—black is and has always
been preferred in ordinary uses. For
ornamental purposes and for occasionally
useful distinctions, various other tints
have been and are adopted—as blue, red,
green, purple, violet, yellow—and so on,
according to the fancy of the maker, or
purchaser, or consumer.</p>

<p class='c000'>The substance employed to receive and
preserve the marks thus made is now
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>almost universally Paper. Parchment is
still used in many legal documents and
writings of form and ceremony. Cotton,
linen and silk, when woven into fabrics for
garments and like uses, are also subjected
to marks of ink for the purpose of identifying
property. So are wooden and
leathern surfaces in similar conditions. It
is also employed in writing on stone, in
the quite modern art of lithography.</p>

<p class='c000'>Though its great original and continual
employment is in writing, it must be
remembered that it is also largely used in
the delineation of objects by artists. Ink
and paint are mutually convertible to each
other’s uses, but are yet so distinct in character
and objects, that no one regards the
words as synonymous, and no precise definition
is needed to teach the distinction
between them. As, for instance, in pen-and-ink
drawings and sketches, the ink
serves the purpose of paint. So likewise
in the letters on sign-boards, &amp;c. paint may
be considered as a substitute for ink. The
artist who traces his name on the canvas
in a corner of his painting, employs paint
in a similar manner. Printing-ink is used
as black paint. In the best red inks, carmine
(a paint in water-colors) is the essential
ingredient. Indian Ink is used here
only as paint,—in China, as ink.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>
  <h2 class='c006'>ETYMOLOGY.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>The derivation of the English word
“<span class='fss'>INK</span>,” and of its representatives in various
modern languages, has caused much perplexity
to philologists, and has been the
subject of many erroneous conjectures. We
suffix the names by which it is known in
those nations who have most employed it:</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>We might amuse ourselves by extending
this tabular list indefinitely. Enough,
however, has been already shown to illustrate
a few remarkable facts which we wish
to present that are connected with the
etymology of our subject; but we present
a page of Lithographic illustrations which
will enable any “curious reader” to trace
the word further.</p>

<p class='c000'>No dictionary of the English language
gives us any help or light about the matter.
Webster suggests “<i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">inchiostro</span></i>,” (the Italian
word,) as the source of derivation; and
all the Italian lexicographers agree that
<i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">inchiostro</span></i> is from the later Latin <span class='fss'>ENCAUSTUM</span>,
which is in fact Greek, Εγκαυστον, (Encauston,)
“<em>burned-in</em> or corroded.” Encaustum became
corrupted into “<i>enchaustrum</i>,” from which
the transition to “<i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">inchiostro</span></i>,” is by the regular
form of derivation from the Latin to
the Italian,—the L before a vowel giving
place to a short I—as “<i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">piano</span></i>” from <span class='fss'>PLANUS</span>.
(The <span class='fss'>CH</span>, in Italian is always sounded
hard, like the English K.)</p>

<p class='c000'>Leaving the French word <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">encre</span></i> as on
the middle ground between different etymologies,
and affording no light either
way,—we find the Spanish and Portugese
“<i><span lang="es" xml:lang="es">tinta</span></i>,” and the German (a language
widely remote from those of the Iberian
peninsula in origin and affinities) “<i>dinte,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>tinte and tincta</i>,” forcibly reminding us of
the Latin participle <span class='fss'>TINCTUS, TINCTA, TINCTUM</span>,
from the verb <span class='fss'>TINGO</span>, which is represented
in English by <span class='fss'>TINGE</span>, and other
derivatives, such as “<em>tincture</em>,” &amp;c. We
cannot refuse to recognize the Holland-Dutch
“<i><span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Inkt</span></i>” as from the same root
to which we have thus traced the corresponding
word in a language which we
may call its “cousin-German;” and it
is hard to exclude the Old French “<i>Enque</i>”
and modern “<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Encre</span></i>” from this circle of
relationship.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then, we are somewhat impressed by
the discovery of the word <i>Ingvas</i> in the
Illyrian, a language of the Slavonic (or
more properly Slovenic) stock, like the
Polish,—and, like that, enriched by words
derived from the Latin. The Polish,
however, presents us with the actual
Graeco-Latin <i>Encaustrum</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>Still more remote from the English and
Italian, we find among the Orientals of
the Shemitish race, <span class='fss'>ANGHAS</span> and <span class='fss'>NIKSON</span> in
the Arabic, and <span class='fss'>N’KASHO</span> in the Chaldee,
with a manifest resemblance in sound, and
with an actual possession of the same elements
and radical letters, N. K. Yet
we do not think of suggesting that these
words had a common origin with the corresponding
ones in European Languages,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>though so nearly coincident in sound. The
case is simply one of accidental resemblance,
a remarkable coincidence,—(because
occurring at three different and remote
points,) but yet a coincidence not wholly
<a id='unpar'></a>unparalleled.</p>

<p class='c000'>The probability is that the English word,
like the Dutch, German, Spanish, &amp;c., came
from the Latin <span class='fss'>TINCTUM</span>, but it may be left
“an open question;” for if we had not these
instances to direct the formation of our
opinions, we should have no hesitation in
acknowledging the Italian <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Inchiostro</span></i> as the
true <span class='fss'>ETYMON</span>; just as, if we had neither of
these in view, we might suspect the origin
of our word to be in the Oriental <span class='fss'>ANGHAS</span> or
<span class='fss'>NIKSON</span>.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Ethiopic <span class='fss'>KALAMA</span> at first sight appears
to be related to the Hindustani <span class='fss'>KALI</span>;
but the latter is merely the word in all the
languages of Hindustan for black,—while
the former is but a modification of the Greek
and Latin <span class='fss'>CALAMUS</span>, a <em>reed</em> or pen,—the instrument
(naturally enough) giving its
name to the liquid which was essential to
its use.</p>

<p class='c000'>The word <span class='fss'>ENCAUSTUM</span> connects, in a very
interesting and instructive manner, both
with the history and the chemistry or manufacture
of our modern inks, and is a satisfactory
demonstration of the utility of such
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>etymological researches as those in which
we have been here indulging.</p>

<p class='c000'>The one great distinction between the
ancient and the modern inks is this: The
old inks were <span class='fss'>PAINTS</span>; the writing inks now
in use by all nations (excepting those of
Southern Asia) are <span class='fss'>DYES</span>. That is the
whole difference.</p>

<p class='c000'>It would be well to give a definition or
limitation of the words “Ancient” and
“Modern.” No one has done it hitherto.
We will not attempt to fix the point precisely,
but may reasonably say that the period
intervening between September, A.D.
410, (when Rome was taken by <span class='fss'>ALARIC</span> and
his Visigoths) and December 25, A.D.
800, (when Karl the Great, otherwise called
Charlemagne, was crowned in Rome by
Pope Leo with the title of Emperor of the
Holy Roman Empire) contains the interval
between antiquity and modern times.</p>

<p class='c000'>The introduction of Paper as the common
material upon which significant characters
were to be marked must have had a great
agency in producing a change in the composition
of the liquid employed in making
the marks.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Parchment</span> was the substance in use,
among all the European nations, as the substratum
of manuscript, from the time when
the Egyptian <em>papyrus</em> went out of fashion.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>Both the parchment and the papyrus
were written upon, by Romans, Greeks and
Hebrews, with pens made of small reeds,
dipped in a fluid composed of <em>carbon</em>, (not
dissolved, but) held in a state of suspension
by an oil or a solution of gum.</p>

<p class='c000'>The letters were originally painted on
the surface of the papyrus, parchment,
board, or other material so employed—the
ink not being imbibed or absorbed by
the substance on which it was shed, but
remaining on the surface, capable of being
removed by washing, scraping, rubbing,
or any similar process. The surface
thus cleansed was then in a state to
receive a new inscription; so that erasions
and inscriptions might be indefinitely
repeated upon it, as upon a modern sign-board.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Modern Ink</span>, on the contrary, leaves its
marks upon paper, parchment, &amp;c., by penetrating
the material to such a depth that
it cannot be erased (mechanically) without
the removal or destruction of the surface
which it has <em>tinged</em>. Chemical agency, as of
various acids, chlorine and its compounds,
is generally employed, therefore, to discharge
the color from modern writing-ink-marks.
<span class='sc'>Carbon</span>, in all its common forms,
(charcoal, bituminous coal, anthracite, jet,
plumbago, lignite, ivory-black, lamp-black
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>and soot,) is wholly unalterable in color by
any of these chemical means.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Printing Ink</span> (which is composed of carbon
suspended in a drying oil) is, in essential
characteristics, identical with the writing-inks
of the ancient Romans and Greeks.
It is impressed upon the surface of paper,
(that which is <em>unsized</em> or bibulous being
commonly preferred,) and is retained unchanged
by the action of moisture, on account
of the insolubility of the carbon and
the repulsion between oil and water. These
two forms of ink are therefore the exact
opposites of each other, in the qualities on
which their use and permanence depend.
The most important peculiarity of the
modern writing-ink, as contrasted with the
ancient, naturally suggested the two names
which it bore in the Latin and Greek of the
middle ages, or (to speak more definitely,)
the time of its invention and first employment.
It was a <em>Tincta</em>, a <span class='fss'>DYE</span>, or <span class='fss'>STAIN</span>,
which <em>tinged</em> and <em>tinctured</em> the material on
which it was placed, entering among its
fibres as coloring fluids do into cloth in the
ordinary processes of manufacture. It
penetrated the substance of the paper (as
caustics or powerful chemical solvents and
corrosives act on the organic fibre): it <em>bit in</em>,
or <em>burned in</em>,—and was therefore well named
<span class='fss'>ENCAUSTON</span> and <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Incaustum</span></i>.</p>

  <h2 class='c006'>CHEMISTRY or COMPOSITION of INK.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>We do not propose to furnish recipes,
prescriptions, directions or instructions for
the manufacture of this article. No mere
statement in words can enable any one to
arrive at perfection, or excellence, or practical
success in the production of this article,
or any articles whatsoever. A skill and carefulness,
which can be acquired only by long
and laborious experience, are indispensable
to the management of the various processes.
Time is an essential element of
success in this peculiar art; and that
makes absolutely requisite also, two other
conditions,—<em>patience</em> and <em>capital</em>. We shall
therefore be brief on this point,—referring
those who wish for minute details, to the
cyclopaedias, dictionaries of the arts and
sciences, and the larger works on practical
chemistry. The following we venture
to present as the most correct account of
this subject, derived from the latest scientific
and practical authorities.</p>

<p class='c000'>The composition of ink varies according
to its colors, and the purposes to which
it is to be applied.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Common black writing-ink</span> is the tannate
of the sesquoxyd of iron mixed with a
smaller quantity of the gallate of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>sesquoxyd of iron. When in the liquid
form, it is generally the tannate and gallate
of the protoxyd; but after being long
kept, (or put on the paper and drying there,)
it absorbs more oxygen from the atmosphere;
and thus the saline compounds become
the per-tannate and per-gallate, which
are blacker than the tannate and gallate of
the protoxyd. It is thus and therefore
that good modern ink is known by the simple
test-quality of darkening by age. On
the other hand, when writing becomes yellow,
pale or indistinct by age, it is from
the decay of the imperfectly combined vegetable
astringent,—the marks on the paper
or parchment being then little more than
the stain of the per-oxyd (that is the sesquoxyd)
of iron. If the written surface
be then carefully washed or even moistened
with the infusion of nut-galls, it will be
rendered blacker, and if before indistinct will
become legible. This may sometimes be
better accomplished by first applying a
weak solution of oxalic acid or very dilute
muriatic (hydro-chloric) acid, and then delicately
laying on the infusion of galls.</p>

<p class='c000'>When the writing paper has been made
of inferior rags, bleached with chlorine, the
best ink used upon it is liable to become
discolored.</p>

<p class='c000'>Nut-gulls or gall-nuts (<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Gallæ-tinctoriæ</span></i>)
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>are excrescences growing upon the leaves
or twigs of oak trees, (especially the <i>Quercus
infectoria</i>,) caused by the puncture of an insect
(the <i>Cynips gallæ-tinctoriæ</i>) which deposits
its eggs in the perforations thus
made. The <i>Quercus infectoria</i> is most abundant
in Persia, Mesopotamia, Syria and
Asia Minor, from which countries the galls
are brought in large quantities to the manufactories
of Europe and America. The
best are called “<span class='sc'>Aleppo</span> galls,” from the
name of the Syrian city which is the chief
original market for them. Those from
Smyrna are also highly esteemed.</p>

<p class='c000'>They contain the vegetable astringent
principle called <em>tannin</em> in greater abundance
than any other known substance. This is
chemically resolved into the acids known
as the tannic and gallic. All the woods and
barks employed in the manufacture of
leather by the tanning of hides contain this
astringent matter in various degrees. The
oak and the hemlock, for instance, are in
extensive and familiar use for this purpose
in the United States. The blackness of
ink, as has been already indicated, is derived
from the combination of these two acids
with oxydized iron in saline compounds
which are insoluble in water, and are therefore
precipitated or deposited at the bottom
of the fluid, unless held mechanically
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>suspended in it, by gum, sugar or some
similar substance which gives the quality
of viscidity to its solutions.</p>

<p class='c000'>The following will serve as a good formula
for making common ink, and will be
enough to give an idea of the ordinary
and general mode of its composition:—“Take
of Aleppo galls finely bruised, six
ounces,—sulphate of iron, four ounces,—gum
Arabic, four ounces,—water, six pints.
Boil the galls in the water for about two
hours, occasionally adding water to supply
the loss from evaporation; then add the
other ingredients; and keep the whole for
two months in a wooden or glass vessel,
which is to be shaken at intervals.
Then strain the ink into glass bottles,
adding a few drops of creosote to prevent
mouldiness.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Besides its property of viscidity, the
gum possesses the power of preventing
the ink from being too fluid: and it also
serves to protect the vegetable matter from
decomposition. The great desideratum or
requisite is that the ink should flow with
perfect freedom from the pen, to allow
rapid writing, and that it should adhere to
the paper, or “bite into it,” so as not to be
effaceable by washing or sponging. The
great defect to be avoided and prevented is
the want of durability. The writing ink
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>of the ancients was characterized by great
permanency, being composed of finely pulverized
carbon mixed with a mucilaginous or
adhesive liquid. <span class='sc'>India</span> or <span class='sc'>China Ink</span> is of
this composition: it is formed of lamp-black
and size or fine animal glue, with the incidental
addition of perfumes. It is used in China
with a brush, both for writing and painting
on Chinese paper; and it is employed in other
countries for making drawings in black and
white,—the different depths of shade being
produced by varying the degree of dilution
in water.</p>

<p class='c000'>Inks of other colors than black were anciently
used only for purposes of ornamental
and decorative writing. In later and present
times, red and blue inks have been extensively
employed in ruling account-books
and other paper for like uses. Blue ink,
within ten or more years past, has been, with
many, a preferred fluid for common writing.</p>

<p class='c000'>Blue ink, when properly made, flows with
great ease and rapidity from the pen, dries
almost instantly on the paper, and has
been supposed or expected to be quite durable,
and unchangeable in color, under ordinary
vicissitudes. Yet, experience has demonstrated
the contrary,—though various and
well-contrived chemical combinations have
been attempted for the purpose. Blue inks
that change to black some time after writing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>are very popular. On well-made and high-priced
paper, and with gold pens, such inks,
if prepared by good chemists, may ultimately
prove worthy of the high esteem in
which they are held; but their absolute and
unchangeable durability is yet to be tested
by experience, before they can be safely
employed for writings of permanent value,
and relied on for use in making records designed
for preservation and reference during
a long course of years.</p>

<p class='c000'>There is a compound of bichromate of
potash and extract of logwood, which forms
a very cheap and convenient writing fluid.
Dr. Ure pronounces it “a vile dye.” Yet it
may have its utilities, in localities remote
from the centres of civilization and commerce,—as
in the new settlements in western
America, in Australia, &amp;c., and for travelers
in Africa, in the Arctic and other
barbarous or uninhabited regions. The
following is the best formula which can be
given for this compound; and we present it
on the highest chemical authority:—“Take
Bichromate of potash, 1-4 oz.—Extract of
logwood 1 oz.—Boiling water, 1 gallon.”</p>

<p class='c000'>We have taken the trouble to give this
prescription or formula, because some quacks
have been peddling it all over the country,
at all sorts of prices, varying (according to
the credulity and liberality of purchasers)
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>from 50 cents to $250. We give it for
just what it is worth; and that is—exactly
what this book costs the reader.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c006'>BIBLIOGRAPHY.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>The longest and most valuable passage
which we find in the writings of any English
author, who has alluded to our subject,
is the following, from “<span class='sc'>The Origin and
Progress of Writing</span>,” by Thomas Astle,
F. R. S., F. A. S. &amp;c., pp. 209 to 212,
2d edition, London, 1803.</p>

<p class='c000'>“<span class='sc'>Of Inks.</span> Ink has not only been useful
in all ages, but still continues absolutely
necessary to the preservation and improvement
of every art and science, and for conducting
the ordinary transactions of life.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Daily experience shows that the most
common objects generally prove most useful
and beneficial to mankind. The constant
occasion we have for Ink evinces its
convenience and utility. From the important
benefits arising to society from its
use, and the injuries individuals may suffer
from the frauds of designing men in the
abuse of this necessary article, it is to be
wished that the legislature would frame
some regulation to promote its improvement,
and prevent knavery and avarice
from making it instrumental to the accomplishment
of any base purpose.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>“Simple as the composition of Ink
may be thought, and really is—it is a fact
well known, that we have at present none
equal in beauty and color to that used by
the ancients; as will appear by an inspection
of many of the manuscripts above
quoted, especially those written in England
in the times of the Saxons. What occasions
so great a disparity? Does it arise
from our ignorance, or from our want of
materials? <span class='sc'>From neither</span>, <em>but from the
negligence of the present race</em>; as very little
attention would soon demonstrate that we
want neither skill nor ingredients to make
Ink as good now as at any former period.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It is an object of the utmost importance
that the Records of Parliament, the
Decisions and Adjudications of the Courts
of Justice, Conveyances from man to man,
Wills, Testaments, and other Instruments
which affect property, should be written
with Ink of such durable quality as may
best resist the destructive powers of time
and the elements. The necessity of paying
greater attention to this matter may be
readily seen by comparing the Rolls and
Records that have been written from the
fifteenth century to the end of the seventeenth,
with the writings we have remaining
of various ages from the fifth to the twelfth
century. Notwithstanding the superior
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>antiquity of the latter, they are in excellent
preservation; but we frequently find the
former, though of more modern date, so
much defaced that they are scarcely legible.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Inks are of various sorts, as—encaustic
or varnish, Indian ink, gold and silver,
purple, black, red, green, and various other
colors. There were also secret and sympathetic
Inks.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The Ink used by the ancients had
nothing in common with ours, but the color
and gum. Gall-nuts, copperas and gum
make up the composition of our Ink;
whereas soot, or ivory-black, was the chief
ingredient in that of the ancients; so that
very old charters might be suspected, if
written with Ink entirely similar to what
we use; but the most acute and delicate
discernment is necessary in this matter; for
some of the [black] Inks formerly used
were liable to fade and decay, and are found
to have turned red, yellow or pale. Those
imperfections are however rare in manuscripts
prior to the tenth century.</p>

<p class='c000'>“There is a method of reviving the writing;
but this expedient should not be
hazarded, lest a suspicion of deceit may
arise, and the support depended on [be] lost.</p>

<p class='c000'>“<span class='sc'>Golden</span> Ink was used by various nations,
as may be seen in several libraries,
and in the archives of churches. <span class='sc'>Silver</span>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>Ink was also common in most countries.
Red Ink, made of vermilion, cinnabar, or
purple, is very frequently found in manuscripts;
but none are found written entirely
with ink of that color. The capital letters,
in some, are made with a kind of varnish,
which seems to be composed of vermilion
and gum. Green Ink was rarely used in
charters, but often in Latin manuscripts,
especially in those of the latter ages. The
guardians of the Greek emperors [or rather
the Regents of the Empire] made use of it
in their signatures, till the latter [the
monarchs during minority] became of age.
Blue or Yellow Ink was seldom used but
in <em>manuscripts</em>.[!!!] The yellow has not
been in use, as far as we can learn, for six
hundred years.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Metallic and other characters were
sometimes burnished. Wax was used as
a varnish by the Latins and Greeks, but
much more by the latter, with whom it
continued a long time. This covering or
varnish was very frequent in the ninth
century.</p>

<p class='c000'>“<span class='sc'>Color.</span> The color of Ink is of no great
assistance in authenticating manuscripts
and charters. There is in my library a long
roll of parchments, at the head of which is
a letter that was carried over the greatest
part of England by two devout monks,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>requesting prayers for Lucia de Vere,
Countess of Oxford, a pious lady, who died
in 1199,—who had formed the house [or
convent] of <a id='henn'></a>Henningham in Essex, and
done many other acts of piety. This roll
consists of many membranes or skins of
parchment sewed together,—all of which,
except the first, contain certificates from the
different religious houses that the two
monks had visited them, and that they had
ordered prayers to be offered up for the
Countess, and had entered her name on their
bead-rolls. It is observable that time hath
had very different effects on the various
inks with which these certificates were
written. Some are as fresh and black as
if written yesterday; others are changed
brown; and some are of a yellow hue. It
may naturally be supposed that there is a
great variety of handwritings upon this;
but the fact is otherwise, for they may be
reduced to three.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It may be said in general, that <span class='fss'>BLACK</span>
ink of the seventh, eighth, ninth and tenth
centuries, at least among the Anglo-Saxons,
preserves its original blackness [thereby
meaning that its “form had not lost all its
original <em>brightness</em>”] much better than that
of succeeding ages,—not even excepting the
sixteenth and seventeenth, in which it was
frequently very bad. Pale ink very rarely
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>occurs before the four last centuries.

<p class='c000'>“Peter Caniparius, Professor of Medicine
at Venice, wrote a curious book concerning
Ink, which is now scarce, though
there is an edition of it printed in London,

for painting or coloring of leather, cloths
made of linen or wool, and for restoring
inks that have been defaced by time, as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>likewise many methods of effacing writing—restoring
decayed paper—and of various
modes of secret writing.—The <em>fifth</em> part
treats of Inks for writing, made in different
countries, of various materials and
colors,—as from gums, woods, the juice of
plants, &amp;c., and also of different kinds of
varnishes.—The <em>sixth</em> part treats of the
various operations of extracting vitriol,
and of its chemical uses.</p>

<p class='c000'>“This work abounds with a great variety
of philosophical, chemical and historical
knowledge, and will give great entertainment
to those who wish for information on
this subject.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Many curious particulars concerning
Ink will be found in “<i>Weckerus de Secretis</i>.”
(Printed at Basle, in 1612, octavo.)—This
gentleman also gives receipts for
making Inks of the color of Gold and
Silver, composed as well with those materials
as without them,—also, directions for
making a variety of Inks for secret writing,
and for defacing of [effacing] Inks.
There are many marvelous particulars in
this last work, which will not easily gain
credit with the judicious part of mankind.”</p>

<p class='c000'>We have chosen to give Mr. Astle’s
paragraphs on this subject, entire, “pure
and simple,” (with no corrections or alterations,
except as to a few particulars in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>spelling, punctuation, &amp;c.,) including some
unnecessary formal verbiage,—instead of
embodying his facts and observations in our
own language. We shall do likewise with
other authors whose books we use in
this work, as the most effectual way of
giving each of them due credit for their
several discoveries and statements, and, at
the same time, securing our own just claims
to what we herein present as of our own
discovery or production. But we will give
no credit to a mere compiler or plagiarist.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Astle was keeper of the ancient
Records of the English Government in the
Tower of London, and thus enjoyed extraordinary
facilities for ascertaining such
facts, and making such observations as he
furnishes in his very useful, interesting, and
elegantly illustrated book. As to what he
says (in his seventh paragraph) about the
inexpediency of “hazarding” any effort to
revive writing which has faded or become
illegible, from fear of “a suspicion of deceit,”—the
caution must of course be limited
to cases where the words proposed to be
restored to legibility have reference to some
question of disputed title, or other matter
in litigation or controversy. Mr. Astle
would not have hesitated (any more than
Angelo Mai) to use any possible process
for the restoration of a <em>palimpsest</em> manuscript
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>of a long-lost work of Cicero or
Livy, or of any document worth the labor
and the time requisite to revive the letters
or read them. Mr. Astle’s slight lapse of
pen or mind in stating (eighth paragraph)
that “Blue or yellow ink was seldom used
except in <em>manuscripts</em>,” reminds us of Noah
Webster’s reason, given in the first edition
of his quarto dictionary, for the use of the
word “Iland” instead of “Island,” viz.,
that the latter spelling was “found only in
books.” Perhaps the venerable Mr. Astle
would have been as much astonished to
learn that he himself had always written
manuscript, whenever he put pen to paper,
as the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bourgeois Gentilhomme</span></i>, in Moliere’s
comedy, was to learn that he “had been
speaking prose all his life.”</p>

<p class='c000'>A comparatively recent author gives the
following as the sum and substance of his
knowledge on this division of the subject
of our book.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c006'>WRITING-INKS.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Dark-colored liquids were used to stain
letters previously engraved on some hard
substance, long before they were made to
flow in the calamus or pen for forming
them on a smooth surface; and the Chinese
made their “Indian Ink” in the same
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>manner as now, 1120 years before the
Christian Era; but, only used it, at that
time, to blacken incised characters.<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c010'><sup>[1]</sup></a> Ink
was termed by the ancient Latin authors
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">atramentum scriborium</span></i>,<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c010'><sup>[2]</sup></a> or <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">librarium</span></i>, to distinguish
it from <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">atramentum sutorium</span></i> or <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">calchantum</span></i>.
It was made of the soot of
resin, or pounded charcoal, and other substances,
mixed with gum, and not, like
ours, of vitriol, gall-nuts, alum, &amp;c. The
earliest positive mention of ink is perhaps
the passage in Jeremiah, in the Vulgate,
“<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ego scribebam in volumine, atramento</span></i>.”<a id='r3' /><a href='#f3' class='c010'><sup>[3]</sup></a></p>

<div class='footnote' id='f1'>
<p class='c000'><a href='#r1'>1</a>. Here we might add, without fear of contradiction,
that <em>Ink</em> is still extensively used
to “blacken characters,” without regard to
the depth of the incision.</p>
</div>

<div class='footnote' id='f2'>
<p class='c000'><a href='#r2'>2</a>. The specimen
of the English language which we quote,
is not faultless; and the <em>Latin</em> is execrable.
There is no such word as <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">scriborium</span></i> in any
language, ancient or modern. The Romans
called writing-ink <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">atramentum scriptorum</span></i>.</p>
</div>

<div class='footnote' id='f3'>
<p class='c000'><a href='#r3'>3</a>. <em>This</em> is a very paltry piece of pedantry.
Why could not this author (who
shows that he does not understand <em>Latin</em>,)
give us the text in English? The passage
is in Jeremiah, chap. <span class='fss'>XXXVI</span>, verse 18: “I
wrote them with <em>Ink</em> in a book.” The
only other references in the Bible to <em>Ink</em>,
are the following: 2 Corinthians, <span class='fss'>III</span>, 3:
“written not with <em>Ink</em>, but the spirit.” 2
John, <span class='fss'>XII</span>: “I would write with paper
and <em>Ink</em>.” 3 John, <span class='fss'>XIII</span>: “I had many
things to write, but I will not with <em>Ink</em>.”
Ezekiel, <span class='fss'>IX</span>, 2: “with a writer’s <em>ink</em>-horn by
his side.”</p>
</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>Gold liquids, and also silver, purple,
red, green, and blue inks, were eventually
used in manuscripts after the fourth century,—red
and gold having been employed
much earlier. St. Jerome speaks of rich
decorations, which must have been executed
with colored inks; but, before his time,
Ovid alludes not only to the purple <i>charta</i>,
made use of for fine books, which were
also tinged with an oil drawn from cedar-wood,
to preserve them, but, also to titles
written in red ink, which were the first
kind of illuminations. The passage occurs
in his first elegy, “Ad Librum:”</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Nec te purpureo velent vaccinia succo;</span></i></div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>The last line proving, as Casley observes,
that Ovid wrote upon a <em>roll</em>.</p>

<p class='c000'>This author, not having been kind
enough to translate Ovid for us, we are
compelled to do it for him. This “Elegy”
of the poet is addressed “To his Book;”
and the following words contain the meaning
of the four lines above quoted:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span><i>Nor shall huckleberries stain [literally, <span class='fss'>VEIL</span>] thee with purple juice:</i></div>
      <div class='line'><i>That color is not becoming to lamentations.</i></div>
      <div class='line'><i>Nor shall title (or “head-letter”) be marked with vermilion, or paper with cedar,</i></div>
      <div class='line'><i>Thou shalt carry neither white nor black horns on thy forehead (or front, or frontispiece).</i></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c012'>The word “huckleberries,” we have rightly spelled here. The dictionaries generally
are wrong in spelling the word “whortleberry.” Huckleberry, or Hockleberry,
is found in the kindred languages of Northern Europe.</p>

<p class='c005'>Diplomas were seldom written in gold
or colored inks; but some charters of the
German Emperors are known, not only in
gold, but on purple vellum; and Leukfeld
mentions one of the year 912, ornamented
also with figures; while several early
English charters have gold initial letters,
crosses, &amp;c. The black ink that has kept
its color best, in mediaeval manuscripts, is
that used from the tenth to the thirteenth
century. The signatures of the Eastern
Emperors are frequently in red ink.</p>

<p class='c000'>Colored inks were common in mediaeval
manuscripts,—the red being most usual for
titles, which has given rise to the term
<i>Rubric</i>. The writers of books (that is, the
copyists,) often appended their names to
the end of the work, generally in ink of a
different color from that of the body of
the work, stating the time and place in
which the work was executed.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>To this may be added, with advantage,
some instructive account of</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c006'>WRITING INSTRUMENTS,</h2>
</div>

<p class='c013'>whose history is closely connected, to a
great extent, with that of writing <span class='fss'>FLUIDS</span>.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Egyptian, and all other oriental
and ancient scribes, who wrote upon stone,
employed (of course) some instrument similar
in character to the chisel of our modern
tomb-stone cutters, or monument letterers.
So with the Greeks and Romans, writing
on surfaces of wax or wood, the instruments
were the graphium, or glypheion,
(the graver,) and the stilus, or caelum, all
of steel or iron. When the use of a dark-colored
liquid or <em>Ink</em> was introduced, there
arose a necessity for instruments of very
different material, and great flexibility, in
opposition to the unyielding rigidity of the
tools previously employed. Then were
invented the first implements properly
called Pens, or really resembling what we
so denominate and use. These were universally
made of vegetable material, growing
in the tubular form, of convenient
size, as the <i>calamus</i>, <i>arundo</i>, <i>juncus</i>, and, in
general terms, the smaller stems of various
plants called “reeds” and “rushes” in
English. We have already mentioned the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>uniform employment of the hair-pencil, or
brush, by the Chinese, from the most ancient
time of their writing. The quill, or
feather-pen, was introduced during the
fourth century.</p>

<p class='c000'>We have alluded to the <i>palimpsest</i> manuscripts.
This is the term applied to
parchments that have been twice written
upon,—the first writing being effaced to
make room for the second. During the
period commonly called “the dark ages,”
the monks and other scribes, copyists or
book-makers, were in the habit of effacing
the letters from old manuscripts, in order
to make a clean surface for a new writing.
In this way was caused the deplorable
destruction of an immense and an inestimably
valuable amount of ancient literature,
of Greek and Roman history, poetry, eloquence
and philosophy, merely to make
room for mass-books, and other works of
stupid superstition and mis-directed devotion,
or, of scholastic theology and philosophy,
now long ago universally condemned
and exploded. Within the past and present
generation, however, the learned world
has been delighted by the surprising recovery
of some of these long-lost treasures,
through the skilful and ingenious labors of
the deservedly famous Cardinal Angelo
Mai, and others, whose researches in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>libraries of Rome, Milan, Padua, Naples,
Florence, and other cities, have resulted
in the restoration of inestimably precious
writings, thus partially obliterated or
obscured.</p>

<p class='c000'>Brande’s Dictionary of Literature,
Science, and Art, gives a brief summary
of the same general facts in the article
“Palimpsest.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The fullest and most elaborate exposition
of the composition and manufacture
of Ink which we have been able to find,
however, is in the great French <a id='dict'></a>“Dictionnaire
des Arts et Manufactures,” by an
association of distinguished <i>savans</i>, in two
volumes, imperial octavo, Paris, 1853,
article, <span class='fss'>ENCRE</span>.</p>

<p class='c000'>But, of all articles and treatises on the
subject, which we have examined, that in
the English Penny Cyclopaedia has the
merit of containing, if not the best and
longest account, a very good and satisfactory
one,—because it expresses all the
essential facts in the fewest and best-chosen
because perfectly intelligible words. As
we do not attempt to furnish a text-book
for ink-manufacturers, we do not transcribe
in full, or translate, from these and other
works of great value on this subject.</p>

<p class='c000'>That modern inks do not resist the
decomposing and destructive power of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>chemical agents (whether acids, alkalies,
saline bodies or elements,) as well as the
ancient inks, is the result of a necessity
existing in their very composition and
invention, and even in the use for which
they were designed, and to which they are
applied. A <em>dye</em> (like modern ink) is the
result of chemical action, and is therefore
subject to chemical re-agents; yet, when
well made, it is proof against mechanical
action, such as washing, rubbing, and
scraping; nor can it be removed from paper
to which it is applied, without destroying
that material, or rendering that part of it
practically useless. But, on the other
hand, the ancient inks, which resist all
chemical processes, can be removed by
mechanical action, such as has been named.
If a new ink were compounded of the two,
possessing the best properties of each, any
writing executed with it could be effaced
by the joint or successive action of mechanical
and chemical applications.</p>

<p class='c000'>It must be borne in mind that the
ancient inks had one use for which writing
ink is now never required; and that was
in making books, or multiplying copies of
manuscripts indefinitely for <em>general reading</em>,
or <em>publication</em>. The invention and universal
employment of the art of printing has
wholly done away with that.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>Of <span class='sc'>Indelible Inks</span>, or those used for
marking fabrics of cotton, linen, &amp;c., for
the identification of ownership, it is not
necessary to give any particular description.
Their ordinary composition is very
generally understood to be a solution of
nitrate of silver, or some similar caustic,
applied with a pen of proper material, to
a portion of the surface of the cloth, which
has been previously prepared by the absorption
of a gummy or mucilaginous
fluid dried upon it under pressure.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Sympathetic Inks</span> are fluids employed
in coloring drawings made for parlor
amusement, or the diversion of children
and youth. As, for instance, a landscape
drawn in ordinary colors with a wintry
aspect, cloudy or sombre sky, snow on the
ground, and leafless trees, if properly
touched with sympathetic inks, will, at
any time, when brought near a fire, or
otherwise subjected to a certain degree of
warmth, change to the hues of summer,
the sky becoming of a clear blue, the trees
in full foliage, and the turf rich with
grass, each with its appropriate shade of
verdure, as also flowers of their various
natural colors, &amp;c., according to the fancy
of the artist, the whole disappearing as
the picture grows cold. The chloride, the
nitrate, the acetate, and the sulphate of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>cobalt, form sympathetic inks,—the first,
blue, and (with the addition of nickel,)
green; the second, red. Chloride of copper
gives a gamboge yellow; bromide of copper,
a fine rich brown.</p>

<p class='c000'>Letters written with a solution of acetate
of lead, are invisible until exposed to
the action of sulphuretted hydrogen, which
makes them distinct, with the lustrous
greyish black of sulphuret of lead, the same
substance which is called galena when it
occurs as lead-ore. A weak infusion of
galls or other vegetable astringent, will, if
applied to paper in the form of letters,
become legible when touched with any
solution of iron. If written with a solution
of ferro-cyanide of potash, letters will
remain invisible until touched with a solution
of sulphate of iron.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c006'>IMPORTANCE OF GOOD INK.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Astle speaks very impressively and
justly on this point; and we contribute to
this part of our subject by calling attention
to facts almost daily occurring or brought
to notice in this country, especially in the
older cities and states, where town-records,
parish-registers, and other documents of
ancient date, and of high importance in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>history, chronology, and genealogy, (as
well as in regard to the title and inheritance
of estates,) are found obscured and
obliterated, causing losses, public and private,
that need but to be mentioned to be
properly estimated.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the appendix will be found a fac-simile
of a sheet upon which various specimens
of ink were thoroughly and fairly
tested, which is a brief but emphatic demonstration
of a difference of qualities by
difference of results.</p>

<p class='c000'>To show what can be done in the preservation
of writing on material even
frailer than such paper as we employ, we
need but produce the specimen of Egyptian
writing on papyrus, pronounced by Champollion
to have been executed more than
sixteen hundred (1600) years before the
birth of Christ, yet still in preservation
and legible, as may be seen by the representation
we give of it.</p>

<p class='c000'>This is undoubtedly as old as any specimen
of phonetic characters or written
letters (representing sounds, not ideas or
objects,) extant, made by marking with a
fluid upon any substance. There are inscriptions
of letters upon stone, for which
an earlier date of 4000 years B.C., is
claimed with truth. But this is <span class='fss'>INK</span>-writing,
absolutely 3500 years old!</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>The Chinese assert that they had the
art of writing at a period 2950 years
before Christ; but they have no records or
monuments of that date; and their characters
even to the present time, are entire
words, representing objects, ideas or things,
not sounds. In the art of printing, they
pretend to have preceded the European
nations about 2400 years, dating their
invention of it from the tenth century
before Christ. But they have never advanced
beyond the first form of the art—letters
engraved on solid wooden blocks—the
very method in use by Koster, and his
associates, until the invention of moveable
types by John Gansfleisch, otherwise
named John Gutenberg or Guttemberg,
in 1435. In both arts, writing and
printing alike, the Chinese have remained
stiff, solid and immovable at the first step,
with the characteristic unchangeability of
the yellow races of Eastern Asia, so opposite
to the indefinitely progressive and self-improving
energy of the nations whose
progenitors proceeded west from the original
source and centre of the earth’s population.
The same ink serves the Chinese
both for writing and printing, as does
the same kind of paper. This ink they
invented about the end of the first century
of the Christian era; before which time
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>they wrote on boards or bamboos. Having
next proceeded to the use of silken cloth
for these purposes, the preparation of
paper from that material naturally followed.
Their ink, being carbonaceous and
oleaginous, is, of course, (like that of the
Egyptians and all the other ancients,)
unfading, and unalterable by chemical
agencies, though capable of being effaced
or obscured by watery applications or
exposure.</p>

<p class='c000'>As to their claim of having <em>invented</em> the
art of printing, we shall have something
to say hereafter.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Aztecs (in Mexico, before the
Spanish discovery and conquest,) extensively
employed a picture-writing, as a
means of recording events, during a period
not exceeding two centuries before that
epoch. They had the art of manufacturing
materials as a basis of such writing,
from the <em>Agave</em> or American aloe, and
from cotton, in the form of a very fine
cloth. They also used prepared skins for
the same purpose, the best specimens of
which are pronounced to be more beautiful
than the finest vellum. Their manuscripts
were sometimes done up in rolls or scrolls,
and frequently on tablets, in the form of a
folding-screen. Their inks appear to have
been coloring matters in watery solutions.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>The oldest Phoenician ink-writing of
which any specimen has been preserved,
dates no later than the second century
before Christ, and may be much older.</p>

<p class='c000'>A fac-simile of a portion of it will be
found among our illustrations, explained
by notes referring to each by its number.</p>

<p class='c000'>Greek manuscripts in ink (on papyrus),
of the third century before Christ, are in
existence. We give specimens of the oldest
known,—one written in Egypt, 260
B.C., being an order from Dioscorides, an
officer of the government of Ptolemy Philadelphus,
to another named Dorion. The
translation of the words is “Dioscorides
to Dorion, greeting. Of the letter to Dorion
the copy is subjoined.” * * * We add
other specimens, of the same and later
periods.</p>

<p class='c000'>Of Latin writing with ink, the earliest
we can find is the palimpsest of Cicero’s
book, “De Republica,” which had been
partly effaced to make room for a copy of
Augustin’s commentary on the Psalms.
It is believed by the learned that the original
manuscript was executed at least as
early as the second or third century of the
Christian era. The restoration of this
manuscript, and the discovery of this long-lost
and earnestly sought classic gem, were
the work of Cardinal Mai, as before mentioned.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>The original words are <span class='fss'>TETERRIMUS
ET EX HAC VEL——</span>, and are written in two
columns on the page, while the later writing
runs completely across the page.</p>

<p class='c000'>Of the earliest writing executed in
France, after that country received its
name from those who conquered it, we give
a specimen from the beginning of a charter
of King Dagobert I, executed A.D. 628.
The words are—“<span class='fss'>QUOTIESCUMQUE PETITIONIBUS</span>”—“However
many times to petitions,”
&amp;c. It is a confirmation of a partition
of property between two heirs. The monogrammatic
autograph of the Great Karl,
(in modern times called Charlemagne,) we
present also as an object of interest. A.D.
800.</p>

<p class='c000'>The oldest specimen of writing in Great
Britain which has been preserved to the
nineteenth century, was a book believed to
be not later than the year 600 of the
Christian era. Astle has preserved an engraved
specimen of it; but the priceless
original has since been destroyed by fire in
the British Museum. It was said to be
a book of Augustin. A specimen still in
existence, dates between the years 664 and
670. It is a charter of Sebbi, King of
the East Saxons, and is easily read:—“I,
Sebbi, King,” &amp;c. We subjoin a few
words from the commencement of a charter
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>of William the Conqueror, whose reign commenced
in England, A.D. 1066:—<span class='sc'>Will:
dei gra<sup>tia</sup> rex</span>, &amp;c., <span class='sc'>Sciatis me concessisse</span>—“William,
by the grace of God, King
&amp;c.: Know ye that I have granted—”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Isaac D’Israeli</span>, in his Curiosities of
Literature, (vol. 2, page 180, of the Boston
edition,) gives a treatise on the “Origin
of the Materials of Writing.” He commences
it with these remarkable words:
“It is curious to observe the various substitutes
for paper before its discovery.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Now, of all “curiosities of literature,”
this little sentence is, in many respects, the
most curious. He talks of substitutes for
a thing not in existence, and not even a
subject of imagination, conjecture, or conception.
The name of D’Israeli does not
indicate an <span class='sc'>Irish</span> origin, but there is a
strong affinity between this and those curiosities
of literature commonly called “Irish
bulls.” As for instance, it reminds us of
the couplet composed by an Irish officer
of a garrison in the Scottish Highlands, in
commemoration of the “good works” of
General Wade, who had caused excellent
military roads to be made through some of
the previously almost impassable morasses
of that region.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>Now, by way of comment on <span class='sc'>D’Israeli</span>,
we will say that “it is very curious,” and
moreover very strange, if not ridiculous,
that he and <span class='sc'>Astle</span>, (from whom he copies
without a full and fair acknowledgment,)
while “deeply complaining of the inferiority
of our inks to those of antiquity,”
have utterly failed to ascertain the cause
or even to notice the occasion of it. They,
as well as other writers on the subject,
observe the excellence of the ink employed
in manuscripts of earlier ages, down to the
twelfth century, and the inferiority of the
ink used from that period down to the close
of the seventeenth century, without turning
attention to the great historical fact that
the <span class='fss'>FIRST PAPER-MILL</span> in Europe was established
in that same twelfth century.</p>

<p class='c000'>A peculiar <span class='fss'>CACHEXY</span> (a variety of the
disease known to <a id='psy'></a>psycho-nosologists as the
<i>cacoëthes scribendi</i>,) seems to be hereditary in
the D’Israeli family. <span class='sc'>Benjamin D’Israeli</span>,
(the son of Isaac,) late Chancellor of the
Exchequer, &amp;c., when he rose in his place,
as the Head or Representative of Her
Majesty’s government in the House of
Commons, to pronounce a eulogy on the
recently deceased Duke of Wellington, had
the impudence to repeat, word for word, a
very bald translation of the <i><a id='elo'></a>éloge</i> delivered
by Lamartine a few years previous, on occasion
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>of the death of one of the third-rate
marshals of Napoleon I.</p>

<p class='c000'>The D’Israeli family are evidently
“some” of the children of Israel, who, (as
we are told on good authority,) when they
left Egypt <em>borrowed</em> everything they could
get, and never, so far as the record shows,
either returned the articles so obtained, or
made proper acknowledgments therefor.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Chinese did manufacture paper
from the bark of the small branches of a
tree of the mulberry genus, (<i>Morus Multicaulis</i>?)
and also from old rags, silk,
hemp, and cotton, as early as the second
century of the Christian era; and it is
supposed that from them the Arabs
derived their knowledge of paper-making,
an art which they introduced into Europe
in the former half of the twelfth century,
when the first paper-mill was put
in operation in Spain, then under the
Moorish dominion; and, in 1150, this
article, as manufactured by them, had
become famous throughout Christendom.</p>

<p class='c000'>[We use the words Arab and Moor indiscriminately
here. The former is the
name of the race; the latter is limited to
that portion found in Northern Africa.
The Moor is the Arab of the <span class='sc'>West</span>, (Al
Mogreb, El Gharb,) in the Arabic, denominated
<span class='sc'>Mogrebyn</span>,—a word which in Roman
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>and European mouths has smoothed and
softened itself into a form suggestive of
the origin of <i>Maurus</i> and <i>Mauritania</i>.]</p>

<p class='c000'>Now, without coming to a positive conclusion
on this subject, we feel authorized
to pronounce what appears to be a reasonable
opinion, derived from all the facts
which we have just placed before the
reader,—that the introduction of writing-paper
among Europeans, was the occasion
and cause of the invention and general
employment of modern writing-ink by
them.</p>

<p class='c000'>The fact that the vegetable astringents
form a deep or bluish black color, when
combined with a salt of iron, had been
known from time immemorial. Among
the Romans, the <i>atramentum sutorium</i>,—“shoemaker’s
ink,”—was applied to a solution
of sulphate of iron employed by
them, as it is even to this day, by workers
in leather, to blacken the surface of that
material. This it does by uniting chemically
with the tannin and gallic acid, by
which the hide was converted into leather,
whose blackened particles are therefore
essentially identical with modern ink. The
“copperas-water” is to be found in every
shoemaker’s shop, where it is used to color
the cut edges of the heels and the rest of
the soles.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>As soon as the difficulty of writing
with convenience and rapidity on paper,
with the ancient carbonaceous ink, became
manifest, the resort to the <i>atramentum sutorium</i>
as a substitute for the <i>atramentum
scriptorium</i>, was a matter of course, and was
but a simple adaptation of a familiar substance
to a new purpose, requiring no great
ingenuity, and no invention whatever.</p>

<p class='c000'>For a time, perhaps through a period of
several centuries, a mixture of the two
kinds of ink was employed by the Romans;
and this was undoubtedly the best
composition that was ever invented for the
purpose of deliberate, careful, elegant
writing, designed and required to be permanent
and unchangeable under constant
exposure and handling,—as in the case of
manuscript books before the art of printing
was known. Even as early as the first
century of the Christian era, in the time of
Pliny the Younger, and probably long
before that, a solution of sulphate of iron
was commonly or frequently added to the
carbonaceous and oleaginous mixture which
we have described as the original writing-ink.
In short, the <i>atramentum sutorium</i>
was added, in moderate quantity, to the
<i>atramentum scriptorium</i>, thus constituting it
a <span class='fss'>CHEMICAL</span> as well as a <span class='fss'>MECHANICAL</span> ink.
So, modern ink may be improved in blackness,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>durability and beauty, and rendered
unchangeable in color under the action of
the chlorides, acids, &amp;c., by the intermixture
of a small quantity of the very finest
carbon, in the form of an impalpable powder.
But, the great difficulty is—that the
carbon clogs the pen, and renders the ink
too thick to flow easily, so that it can
never be used for rapid or ordinary writing.
We can not give, in our own words, a
better account of this matter than we find
in the language of a very learned author
in the Edinburgh Review, (volume 48,
Dec. 1828).</p>

<p class='c000'>The article here cited is entitled “<span class='sc'>The
Recovery of Lost Writings</span>,” and is
nominally a review of [1]<span class='sc'>Gaii Institutionum
Commentarii</span>: [2]<span class='sc'>Institutes de Gaius, recemment

ejusdem Praefecti</span></i>. The article begins on
page 348 of this volume of the Review.</p>

<p class='c000'>We quote from page 366;—“The ink
which the ancients generally used, was
composed of lamp-black mixed with gum,
as we are informed by Dioscorides and
others, who give the receipt [recipe?] for
making it. Ink of this kind may be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>called carbonic: it possesses the advantages
of extreme blackness and durability, the
writing remaining fresh so long as the substance
on which it is written exists; but as
it does not sink into the paper, it is liable
to the great inconvenience of being easily
and entirely removed; for, if a wet sponge
be applied to it, the writing may be washed
away, and no traces of the characters will
remain. The facility with which documents
might be thus obliterated, gave occasion
to fraud, as an artful forger was able
to remove such portions of the original
writing as he might desire to get rid of,
and thus profit by the absence of material
words, or insert in the blanks which he had
made, such interpolations as might serve
his turn. Many common accidents, by
which books and writings were exposed to
wet, or even to damp, were also fatal, or at
least highly injurious, to compositions and
muniments of great value. Various expedients
were therefore attempted to remedy
an imperfection from which many must
have suffered severely. <span class='sc'>Pliny</span> informs us
that it was usual, in his time, to mix vinegar
with the ink, to make it <em>strike into the
paper or parchment</em>, and that it, in some
degree, answered the purpose. It should
seem that vitriolic ink, such as we use at
present, was also adopted soon afterwards,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>which possesses, in perfection, the quality
that was desired of sinking instantly into
the paper, so as to make it far more difficult
to discharge it without destroying the
texture on which it is written, and of being
perfectly secure against water, by which
Indian and other carbonic Inks are so
easily effaced. <span class='sc'>It is not</span>, however, <span class='fss'>EQUALLY
SECURE AGAINST THE EFFECTS OF TIME</span>; for
vitriolic ink gradually fades away, becomes
paler by degrees, turns brown and yellow,
and is scarcely legible; and sometimes, as
the parchment grows yellow and brown with
age, it disappears altogether. A compound
kind of ink came next into use, which
united the advantages and avoided the defects
of the two simple sorts. Such a mixed
ink was generally used for several centuries;
and with this, the manuscripts that are now
most fresh and legible appear to have been
written. It is evident that the ink with
which the original works contained in the
Palimpsest manuscripts that have been
deciphered were written, was at least in
part vitriolic: for the letters which had
been rubbed out <em>were rendered legible by the
application of the infusion of galls</em>. In order
to remove the original writing, the parchments
on which the mixed ink had been
used were, probably, first washed to take
off the carbon, and thus partially to efface
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>the characters, and were afterwards scraped
or rubbed with pumice, or some other suitable
substance, to complete the process
of destruction, by taking away mechanically
the color that the vitriolic portion
of the ink still preserved. It is
but too probable that many manuscripts,
the characters of which were entirely
formed of the more ancient carbonic ink,
have been entirely destroyed, the letters
having been washed off completely, and by
the same simple means as the writing of
a school-boy on a slate; whilst the parchment
still remains in our libraries, and is
covered with more modern compositions
which have sacrilegiously and too successfully
usurped the place of more ancient
and more valuable matter. The tirades
of Cyril or of Jerome, or the tawdry eloquence
of Chrysostom, are perhaps firmly
established in quarters from whence [?] the
Margites of Homer, or the comedies of
Menander, were miserably dislodged.</p>

<p class='c000'>“A manuscript is called Palimpsest,
from the adjective παλιμψαιστος or παλιμψηστος,
signifying twice rubbed; <span class='fss'>NOT</span> as the glossary
of Du Cange (<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">membrana iterum abrasa—charta
deletilis</span></i>) would seem to denote, because
the parchment had twice undergone
abrasure, or the writing been twice obliterated,
but because it had been twice prepared
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>for writing, which was principally effected
by rubbing it with pumice, first in the
course of manufacture, after the original
skin had been cured, and again by the
same process, after the original writing had
been taken away by washing, or in any
other manner. The strict and precise
sense of Palimpsest is therefore ‘twice
prepared for writing;’ the repetition of
such preparation being the prevailing idea
in the etymology, and <em>not erasure</em>, as some
have erroneously supposed. It is said to
be easy to remove from modern parchment,
especially if what is written be of some
standing, all traces of writing, by rubbing
it with pumice, or similar substances; and
if the surface be afterwards polished, no
one, by merely looking on it, will ever suppose
that it had ever been written upon;
but, if it be washed by <em>an infusion of galls</em>,
the letters will be so far restored, particularly
if it be suffered to remain some time
in the light, that it may be copied by a
patient and practiced person, who is gifted
with good eyes:—so deeply had the iron
entered into the soul of the parchment!
If the erased letters were written in a bold
large hand, the task of deciphering them
will of course be less troublesome, and the
results more sure. And such are the characters
of the more ancient manuscripts;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>for, the older the manuscript, the better
and more legible is the writing, as approaching
more nearly to the ages of
civility and refinement. The method of
writing in old times is also favorable, it is
said, to the restoration of works apparently
obliterated. The scribe did not use
a flowing ink, nor a finely pointed pen, as
modern writers are wont; nor was a small
quantity applied so lightly and sparingly
as to dry almost as fast as it touches the
paper. The ancient ink was thick with
gum, and was supplied copiously by a pen
with a broad point, usually made of a reed;
and the characters were <em>painted</em> rather than
written, the ink rather resembling paint or
varnish than our thin liquor. As they
rarely wrote in books, it was not necessary
that the page should dry speedily, or be
dried by means of sand and blotting-paper,
in order to prevent the loss of time, and
that the penman might turn over the leaf
immediately; the loose sheets or leaves, on
the contrary, which were only to be bound
up when the whole was completed, were
left to dry slowly, so that the pools of ink
which formed the letters, stood long on the
surface of the parchment; and that part
of the fluid which was of a penetrating
nature was gradually absorbed, and sunk
deeply into the substance of the skin, so as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>to preserve to us—if we be not wanting to
ourselves in diligence—many precious relics
of ancient lore. The restoration of
the original writing in a palimpsest manuscript
will be best explained by referring to
one of the many kinds of sympathetic ink,
which is in truth, making common ink <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ex
post facto</span></i>, or uniting the ingredients of
which it is composed, after the fact of
writing. If we write with water in which
copperas has been dissolved, the letters will
be invisible; but when the paper has been
washed over with an infusion of galls, they
will appear gradually, and will in time
become tolerably legible; the ink being thus
formed upon the paper, although much less
perfectly, than in the ordinary maceration.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Little or nothing can be added to the
full and elaborate history of ancient and
modern inks which is contained in this
extract,—so thorough and complete in its
analysis of the subject, and so clear in its
distinct statements of the results of investigations
in which some of the most acute
minds of Europe have long been successfully
employed, that we will not linger
upon it with mere verbal criticism.</p>

<p class='c000'>We can not present a more striking
illustration of the change in the composition
of inks about the time of the invention
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>of the art of printing, than is furnished
by the annexed fac-simile of a page in the
<span class='sc'>Biblia Pauperum</span>, (“Bible for poor folks,”)
the oldest printed book in the world. This
extraordinary book is of uncertain date.
(No printed book has a date prior to
1457.) There are, as we believe, only
two copies of it in America, one in the
possession of <span class='sc'>James Lenox</span>, of New-York,—the
other in the <span class='sc'>Astor Library</span>.</p>

<p class='c000'>The maker of this book was the unconscious
inventor of the art of printing.
Wood-engraving was in use for ages
before it occurred to the mind of man that
a letter might be as easily reproduced in
that way as a picture or figure. To convey
scriptural history to the minds of the
common people, the wood-engravers (whose
art was invented to multiply and cheapen
the production of <span class='fss'>PLAYING-CARDS</span>) made little
pictures representing scenes described,
and events narrated, in the Bible. For
the benefit of the few who could read, it
was customary to write on the margin, or
at the foot, of the page on which the woodcut
was printed, a few words descriptive
of the subject or object delineated. This
was always done with a pen, by a regular
scribe, until, one day, it occurred to the
wood-engraver employed on the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Biblia Pauperum</span></i>,
that these words might be as easily
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>engraved as the figures to which they
referred, and of which they were the explanation.
He put that idea in practice: and
in an instant the sublime <span class='fss'>ART OF PRINTING</span>
was an “accomplished fact.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The advocates of the claims of Koster,
Gansefleisch, (or Gutenberg,) Faust (or
Fust,) and Schoeffer, to this invention,
have wasted much labor in bringing forth
conflicting testimony about them. The
long-forgotten and now wholly unknown
wood-engraver of the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Biblia Pauperum</span></i> had
preceded them by half of a generation.
Such books were in existence before A.D.
1420; and the earliest date which the
Haarlaem Dutchmen set up for the first
printing of their fellow-townsman, Lawrence
Koster, is 1428. And his pretensions
are after all very dubious. Indeed
they have been generally condemned as
utterly fabulous by bibliographical critics
and typographical historians.</p>

<p class='c000'>We introduce it here to show the <em>color</em>
and the (thereby indicated) composition of
the <span class='fss'>INK</span> employed. It was <em>writing-ink</em>.
It contained sulphate of iron (copperas),
in combination with vegetable astringent
matter, and with very little carbon. The
vegetable substance, imperfectly united to
the mineral ingredient, has (in obedience to
the laws of organic matter) been decomposed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>and “resolved into its original elements.”
It has disappeared; but the
<span class='fss'>IRON</span> remains with its yellow stain, an
imperishable memorial of that humble,
nameless workman, more enduring than
that which the plaintive man of Uz desired;
for if those words had been “graven
with an <span class='fss'>IRON PEN</span> and lead in the rock <em>forever</em>,”
that anticipated eternity might have
faded of realization by the action of the
rain, the frost, the dust, and innumerable
imaginable atmospheric vicissitudes, or,
(what is worse,) “the wrath of man.”—Some
Cambyses might have demolished
the rock itself, and left no more of the
inscription than can now be read of those
once carved on the cliffs of Edom, the God-created
walls of Petra in the valley of
<span class='sc'>El Ghor</span>.</p>

<p class='c000'>This pale rusty <span class='fss'>WORD-STAMPING</span> on the
fragile and easily combustible paper, has
outlasted the inscriptions once visible in
gigantic characters on the four sides of the
Memphitic pyramids; and it is only an
incidental result of the intelligence diffused
and the learning promoted by the invention
thus begun, that we can now read the long-buried
records of Nineveh, the epitaphs
of the Thebaic kings, and the gravings on
the precipitous fronts of the mountains
which surround the ruins of Persepolis.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>All writers upon this subject have
strangely overlooked the fact that the art of
impressing or printing letters with a metallic
stamp or type on parchment, as a substitute
for pen-work, is about a thousand
years older than the period above specified
as the date of the invention of the modern
art of printing. The <span class='sc'>Codex Argenteus</span>,
(the oldest translation of the entire Bible
into any European language,) is a famous
book, in the Library of the University of
Upsala in Sweden.</p>

<p class='c000'>(We give the particulars of its history
in our Appendix.)</p>

<p class='c000'>This “antique” is on purple <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">vellum</span></i>,
(which is parchment made of <em>calf-skin</em>,) and
all the letters are <span class='fss'>SILVER</span>, (whence the name
Codex Argenteus, the “silver book,”)
manifestly impressed on the page by a
metallic stamp or type, each letter evidently
being on a separate stock or handle,
and applied by manual pressure. We
give a specimen of this style of work. It
may be called printing, but can not be
denominated <em>manuscript</em>, for that is (literally)
“hand-writing,” which this certainly
is not.</p>

<p class='c000'>In our Appendix may be found still
earlier instances of this art as practiced by
the ancient Romans on a small scale, in
signatures, trade-marks, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>The Edinburgh review refers to Pliny
and Dioscorides, as furnishing directions
for the manufacture of ink. The Edinburgh
reviewer says “receipts,”—not recognizing
the broad distinction between a
<em>receipt</em> and a <em>recipe</em>. The former of these
two words was originally intended to convey
the idea that the person who signs the
paper has <em>got</em> something: the latter word,

“<em>take</em>.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“<span class='sc'>Ink</span> (or literally) <span class='sc'>Blacking</span>.—Ink also
may be set down among the artificial (or
compound) drugs, although it is a mineral
derived from two sources. For, it is sometimes
developed in the form of a saline
efflorescence,—or is a real mineral of sulphureous
color—chosen for this purpose.
There have been painters who dug up from
graves colored coals (<span class='fss'>CARBON</span>). But all
these are useless and new-fangled notions.
For it is made from soot in various forms,
as (for instance) of burnt rosin or pitch.
For this purpose, they have built manufactories
not emitting that smoke. The
ink of the very best quality is made from
the smoke of torches. An inferior article
is made from the soot of furnaces and
bath-house chimneys. There are some
(manufacturers) also, who employ the dried
lees of wine; and they <span class='fss'>DO</span> say that if the
lees so employed were from good wine, the
quality of the ink is thereby much improved.
Polygnotus and Micon, celebrated
painters at Athens, made their black paint
from burnt grape-vines; they gave it the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>name of <span class='fss'>TRYGYNON</span>. <span class='sc'>Apelles</span>, we are told,
made <span class='fss'>HIS</span> from burnt ivory, and called it
elephantina “ivory-black.” Indigo has
been recently imported,—a substance whose
composition I have not yet investigated.
The dyers make theirs from the dark crust
that gradually accumulates on brass-kettles.
Ink is made also from torches (pine-knots),
and from charcoal pounded fine in
mortars. “The cuttle-fish” has a remarkable
quality in this respect; but the coloring-matter
which it produces is not used
in the manufacture of ink. All ink is
improved by exposure to the sun’s rays.
Book-writers’ ink has gum mixed with it,—weaver’s
ink is made up with glue. Ink
whose materials have been liquified by the
agency of an acid is erased with great
difficulty.”</p>

<p class='c005'>This sounds very much like nonsense:
but it is exactly what the “Great Naturalist,”
Pliny, meant when he wrote all that
<em>he</em> knew, and probably all that was then
known on the subject of ink, black paints
and dyes, and very dark-colored fluids
generally, which were then employed by
painters, dyers, weavers, writers and physicians.
To make his chapter on this subject
fully intelligible to us, we must bear in
mind the fact, that the great science of <em>Chemistry</em>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>had no existence till many centuries
after Pliny wrote. And thus, it never
occurred to him that there was but one
substance, (now known to be elementary,)
<span class='fss'>CARBON</span>, which gave the quality of blackness
to all the materials which he names,
with the exception of one salt of copper,
and probably one of iron, (the sulphate,)
and <span class='sc'>Indigo</span>, a purely vegetable substance,
the dried coloring matter of a plant in

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Pedanius Dioscorides</span>, born in Anazarbus,
(a city of Cilicia, about fifty miles
from <span class='sc'>Tarsus</span>, the birth-place of the Apostle
Paul,) wrote a book on the Materia Medica,
or the qualities of drugs, a little after
the time when Pliny composed his Natural
History. Neither of them seems to have
been acquainted with the writings of the
other. Apparently, they lived, wrote and
died nearly or actually cotemporary, in the
same empire, utterly ignorant of each
other’s existence,—though they are now
universally recognized as the two most
eminent writers of all antiquity on the
subjects of Natural History and the Materia
Medica. They both lived in the
reign of Nero, and the date of the active
or middle part of both their lives may be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>reasonably placed at or about the year
100 of the Christian Era.</p>

<p class='c000'>From Dioscorides to <span class='sc'>Linnæus</span>, (in the
last century,) the Materia Medica made
no actual progress and received no scientific
improvement; yet, eminent as is Dioscorides,
he was so little known to his own
generation or that next following, that it
is now impossible to ascertain the exact
date of his birth or of his death, or any
facts in his life, but that he wrote two
books, of which that here quoted is the
best known, and has made him known
1700 years after his birth.</p>

<p class='c000'>(We may mention that this Dioscorides
was, in no traceable degree, related to the
person of the same name, whose manuscript
we have copied in our illustrations
as the oldest extant specimen of Greek
ink-writing.)</p>

<p class='c000'>We give a translation of his brief but
complete description of the ink used in his
time, and the Latin version, that those
who wish may satisfy themselves of the
correctness of our rendering. It will be
seen that it occurs at the close of the great
work of Dioscorides:—</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span><span class='sc'>Celsus</span>, who lived in this world, about
the commencement of the Christian era,
has left a little memorandum on this subject
which is worth quoting.</p>

<p class='c000'>We give his words entire:—</p>

<p class='c000'>There are two kinds of bald spots
occurring on the human head,—one of them
a baldness which creeps over the scalp like
a serpent,—the other showing itself in the
form of round spaces uncovered by hair.
Some recommend the use of acrid irritant
articles, combined with oils, &amp;c. But
there is nothing better for you than to have
the bald place shaved every day with a
[very dull] razor, and, after having done
that, you needn’t do anything else but rub
on the place thus shaved a little <i>atramentum
sutorium</i>—(“shoemakers’ ink,” “copperas-water,”)—[solution
of the Di-proto
sulphate of the (per) sesquoxyd of iron].</p>

<p class='c000'>The editor of the printed copy of the
edition of the works of <span class='sc'>Aulus Cornelius
Celsus</span> which was printed in Padua, made
a material error on this point.</p>

<p class='c000'>The word “sutorium” (being unintelligible
to the ignorant monk who superintended
the printing) was changed to “scriptorium,”—that
is, “writing-ink,” instead
of “shoemakers’-ink.” It is well-known
that a solution of copperas properly made,
will remedy or prevent premature baldness;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>but we assert that no quantity of lamp-black
and gum, or grease, will be found
effectual for that purpose.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the time of Celsus, the sulphate of
iron (copperas) had not yet become an
essential ingredient of writing-ink; and
even after that its combination with carbonaceous
and oleaginous matters entirely
neutralized the power which renders it
applicable and useful in such cases.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c006'>CONCLUSION.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>We have thus herein attempted the fulfilment
of the promise (with which we
began) to produce a “<span class='sc'>History of Ink</span>,”—a
thing never before done or even proposed to
be done. If not successful in our attempt,
we hope that we have at least, in this little
book, furnished hints and suggestions on
this subject which the learned may employ
hereafter when the history of this important
material of history shall be undertaken
and executed on a larger scale. In
view of which possibility, we may, with a
pardonable self-gratulation, say,—in the
words of Martin Luther,—“We have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>given to other and higher spirits occasion
to reflect.”</p>

<p class='c000'>But we are loth to leave this subject
(which has grown into our affections as we
have dwelt upon it) without giving a blow
or a kick to one monstrous absurdity which
has prevailed among the learned, “falsely
so-called,”—from the time when the Jesuits
returned from China with their
“edifying and curious” tales about the
huge antiquity of all the arts and some of
the sciences of civilization among the people
of what they called the “Celestial
Empire,”—a term wholly unknown to the
Chinese, in any form or variation of expression.</p>

<p class='c000'>The simple facts are that—the Chinese
derived their knowledge of <span class='sc'>Ink</span> (of writing
with a colored liquid) from Europe. So did
they obtain their knowledge of the art of
printing, carried to them by Venetian travelers,
“overland,” just at the moment
before the clumsy engraved wood-blocks
were superseded by the moveable types of
Gansefleisch or Gutenberg. So was it
with the Mariner’s Compass, the manufacture
of gunpowder, and all their boasted
“inventions,”—among which may be included
their calculation of eclipses backward
through fabulous cycles of centuries,
and the morals of Confucius or Kong-foo-tsee,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>a mythical personage unmentioned in
the history of China until the contents of
the New Testament had been made
known there,—and <em>that</em>—many ages after
the date of his supposed life and death.</p>

<p class='c000'>But for their derivation and appropriation
or theft of the great arts from the
West, the Chinese and all Oriental nations,
from the Euphrates to the Pacific, including
the Japanese, would have remained
to this day in the condition in which the
Mexicans and Peruvians were found by
the Spanish and Italian robbers who first
explored the Western Hemisphere, and
murdered its inhabitants for their land, and
the fruits and the gold and silver of that
land.</p>

<p class='c000'>Whatever arts the Chinese or Japanese
or Jesuits may have invented or preserved,
the art of <span class='fss'>TELLING THE TRUTH</span> is evidently,
to all of them, one of “<span class='fss'>THE LOST ARTS</span>,“—lost
irretrievably and forever!</p>

<p class='c000'>The colored engraving is an illustration of the
picture writing of the Mexicans, from Lord Kingsborough’s
great work. The blue border represents a
series of years, distinguished by the dots. The compartment
with five dots representing the fifth year
of the reign, that with ten the tenth, and so on.
The pictures of the acts of the Prince being connected
with each special year by means of a connecting
line. The additional symbols have different
significations—that of the flower signifying a calamitous
year, &amp;c. In this plate King Acamapich is
represented in the first and sixth year of his reign;
at the top of the page are warlike instruments, signifying
his preparation for war; the figures below,
on the right, are the four cities—Quahnahuac,
Mezquic, Cuitlhuac and Xochimilco—represented by
descriptive symbols. The four heads on the left are
those of the respective kings or chiefs of these cities,
beheaded by Acamapich, each distinguished by the
iconographic symbol by which his name was expressed
in this system of writing.</p>

<p class='c000'><b>These picture records, which would have illustrated the unknown history of
this continent, were destroyed in “mountain heaps” by the first Spanish archbishop
of Mexico—an act of fanatical vandalism equalled only by the burning
of the Alexandrian Library, and the vast hoard of Moorish literature at Granada
by Ximenes.</b></p>

PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK</h2>

<p>To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project

<h3 class="pg">Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works</h3>

<p>1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your

Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.</p>

<p>1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.</p>

<p>1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.</p>

<p>1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.</p>

<p>1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:</p>

<p>1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:</p>

<blockquote><p>This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United
  States and most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost
  no restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use
  it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with
  this eBook or online
  at <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
  are not located in the United States, you'll have to check the laws
  of the country where you are located before using this
  ebook.</p></blockquote>

<p>1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted

<p>1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread

contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

<h3 class="pg">Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3 class="pg">Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3 class="pg">Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
